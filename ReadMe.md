## Add your files
Before doing anything ,make sure you downloaded [git](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/install-git?section=git-for-mac-installer)

You can add your files by:

- Create or upload files using github

After that, create a directory named `matricNo_name` and store your files within it.
You can now add the files to the repository:

### Add files

```shell
makedir <matricNo_name>
git add <matricNo_name>/*
```

![](docs/readme03.PNG)

For this tutorial, I have added two files `a random file.txt` and `put your files here.txt`.
To verify that the files are added successfully, you may use the command:

```shell
git status
```

### Commit (Save) files

You can then commit the files using:

```shell
git commit -m "<commit-message>"
```

To verify that you made a commit, you may use the Git log to check the commit history:

```shell
git log
```

Note: use the `q` key to quit from commit history.

### Push (Upload) commits

Now you can push your changes to GitLab by:

```shell
git push origin <branch-name>
```

You should be able to view your pushed branch in the GitLab repository now.
